# serve-sim

The `npx serve` of Apple Simulators. 

Host your simulator for use with Agent tools like Codex, Cursor, or Claude Desktop — locally, over your LAN, or host on a remote mac and tunnel anywhere. 

```sh
npx serve-sim
# → Preview at http://localhost:3200
```

`serve-sim` spawns a small Swift helper that captures the simulator's framebuffer via `simctl io`, exposes it as an MJPEG stream + WebSocket control channel, and serves a React preview UI on top. It works with any booted iOS Simulator — no Xcode plugin, no instrumentation in your app.

## Features 

- Full 60 FPS video stream in the browser.
- Swipe from the bottom to go home.
- gestures like pinch to zoom by holding the option key.
- Simulator logs are forwarded to the browser for browser-use MCP tools to read from.
- Drag and drop videos and images to add them to the simulator device. 
- Keyboard commands and hot keys are forwarded to the simulator, including CMD+SHIFT+H to go home.
- Apple Watch, iPad, and iOS support.

## Why?

Hosted simulators can be hard to test, `serve-sim` enables you to test the hosted infra locally first for faster iteration. When you're ready to host a simulator remotely, simply tunnel the served URL and users can interact with the simulator as if it were running locally on their device.

I develop the Expo framework, but this tool is completely agnostic to React Native and can be used for any iOS interaction you need.

## Install

Requires macOS with Xcode command line tools (`xcrun simctl`) and Node.js 18+. `bun` is **not** required to run the CLI. Camera injection uses a host-side helper built for macOS 14+.

```sh
serve-sim                              # auto-detect booted sim, open preview
serve-sim "iPhone 16 Pro"              # target a specific device

# Stream a physical device (see “Physical devices” below for one-time setup)
serve-sim device                       # first connected iPhone/iPad
serve-sim device "iPhone"              # target a device by name
serve-sim device --host 0.0.0.0        # expose the viewer on your LAN

# Type text into the focused field
serve-sim type "Hello, world!"
echo "from stdin" | serve-sim type --stdin
serve-sim type --file ./snippet.txt

# Camera injection
serve-sim camera com.acme.MyApp                            # animated placeholder
serve-sim camera com.acme.MyApp --webcam                   # default webcam
serve-sim camera com.acme.MyApp --webcam "MacBook Pro Camera"
serve-sim camera com.acme.MyApp --file ~/Pictures/face.png # static image

# Hot-swap source on a running helper (no app relaunch)
serve-sim camera switch placeholder
serve-sim camera switch webcam
serve-sim camera switch ~/Movies/loop.mp4                  # auto-detects file kind

# Other helpers
serve-sim camera mirror on

serve-sim camera --list-webcams
serve-sim camera --stop-webcam
```

Multiple booted simulators are supported — pass several device names, or leave it empty to attach to all of them.

### Camera

`serve-sim camera <bundle-id>` replaces the simulator's camera feed for a single app. A small host-side helper writes BGRA frames into a POSIX shared-memory region; an injected dylib (`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`) swizzles AVFoundation inside the simulator process so the app reads from that region instead of the simulator's stub camera.

The helper is one-per-device and outlives any single app launch, so multiple apps on the same simulator can share the feed — just run `serve-sim camera <other-bundle-id>` again to relaunch the next app with the dylib attached. Source changes (`camera switch`) and mirror changes (`camera mirror`) flow through the helper's control socket and don't relaunch the app.

Sources:

- **placeholder** — animated programmatic frames (default).
- **file** — image (PNG/JPEG/HEIC/…) or video (mp4/mov/m4v/webm/…). The CLI sniffs the kind from the extension and falls back to magic bytes for files without an extension.
- **webcam** — live `AVCaptureDevice` (built-in, Continuity, external).

## Physical devices

`serve-sim device` streams a real iPhone or iPad to the browser — useful on Intel
Macs that can't boot Apple-silicon simulators, or any time you want to drive a
physical device. Real devices have no simulator framebuffer or synthetic-touch
APIs, so device mode drives [WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent)
(an XCUITest runner) for the live screen plus tap/swipe/button input.

```sh
serve-sim device                       # first connected device → http://localhost:3300
serve-sim device "iPhone"              # target a device by name or udid
serve-sim device --port 4000           # custom viewer port
serve-sim device --host 0.0.0.0        # expose on the LAN (viewer is unauthenticated)
```

The viewer at `http://localhost:3300` shows the live screen (MJPEG) and forwards
pointer events: a press is a tap, a press-and-drag is a swipe, and the **Home**
button presses the hardware home. The first run builds and code-signs
WebDriverAgent onto the device with your Apple ID — subsequent runs reuse it.

### One-time setup

Requires Xcode (not just the command line tools) and a free or paid Apple
Developer account for signing:

```sh
pipx install pymobiledevice3
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent.git \
  ~/.serve-sim-device/WebDriverAgent
```

Plug in the device and tap **Trust** when prompted, then run `serve-sim device`.

### Environment overrides

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SERVE_SIM_WDA_DIR` | Path to the WebDriverAgent checkout (default `~/.serve-sim-device/WebDriverAgent`). |
| `SERVE_SIM_WDA_TEAM` | Apple Developer Team ID for signing (auto-detected from your signing identity when omitted). |
| `SERVE_SIM_WDA_BUNDLE_ID` | Bundle id for the WDA runner (default `com.serve-sim.wda.runner`). |

## Connectors

`serve-sim` can be used with dev servers, browser, and AI editors for more seamless integration.

### Agent Skill

An [Agent Skill](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview) ships in [`skills/serve-sim`](skills/serve-sim) — it teaches AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and any host implementing the open Agent Skills standard) how to drive a simulator through the CLI: taps, gestures, hardware buttons, rotation, camera injection, and handing the stream off to the host's preview pane.

```sh
bunx add-skill EvanBacon/serve-sim
# in Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add EvanBacon/serve-sim
```

See [`skills/serve-sim/README.md`](skills/serve-sim/README.md) for the full capability list.

### Claude Code Desktop

Create a `.claude/launch.json` and define a server:

```json
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Apple",
      "runtimeExecutable": "npx",
      "runtimeArgs": ["serve-sim"],
      "port": 3200
    }
  ]
}
```

### Expo

Automatically start the serve-sim process with `npx expo start` and access the URL at `http://localhost:8081/.sim`.

First, customize the `metro.config.js` file (`bunx expo customize`):

```js
// Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const connect = require("connect");
const { simMiddleware } = require("serve-sim/middleware");

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

config.server = config.server || {};
const originalEnhanceMiddleware = config.server.enhanceMiddleware;
config.server.enhanceMiddleware = (metroMiddleware, server) => {
  const middleware = originalEnhanceMiddleware
    ? originalEnhanceMiddleware(metroMiddleware, server)
    : metroMiddleware;
  const app = connect();
  app.use(simMiddleware({ basePath: "/.sim" }));
  app.use(middleware);
  return app;
};

module.exports = config;
```

## Embed in your dev server

`serve-sim/middleware` is a Connect-style middleware that mounts the same preview UI inside your existing dev server (Metro, Vite, Next, plain Express, etc.). Run `serve-sim --detach` once to start the streaming helper, then add the middleware:

```ts
import { simMiddleware } from "serve-sim/middleware";

app.use(simMiddleware({ basePath: "/.sim" }));
// → preview HTML at /.sim
// → state JSON  at /.sim/api
// → SSE logs    at /.sim/logs
```

The middleware reads the helper's state from `$TMPDIR/serve-sim/` and forwards the user's browser to the live MJPEG + WebSocket endpoints. CORS is wide-open on the helper, so the page renders without a proxy.

## How it works

```
┌──────────────┐   simctl io   ┌─────────────────┐  MJPEG / WS  ┌─────────┐
│ iOS Simulator│ ────────────► │ serve-sim-bin   │ ───────────► │ Browser │
└──────────────┘   (Swift)     │ (per-device)    │              └─────────┘
                               └─────────────────┘
                                       ▲
                                  state file in
                                $TMPDIR/serve-sim/
                                       ▲
                               ┌──────────────────┐
                               │ serve-sim CLI /  │
                               │ middleware       │
                               └──────────────────┘
```

The Swift helper (`bin/serve-sim-bin`) is a tiny standalone binary — no Xcode dependency at runtime. The CLI embeds it via `bun build --compile`, so installing the npm package is enough.

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run --filter serve-sim build         # build the JS bundles
bun run --filter serve-sim build:swift   # rebuild the Swift helper
bun run --filter serve-sim dev           # watch mode
```
